# dqn_atari
Tensorflow implementations of the DQN atari.

Double dueling DQN vs DQN with the same parameters:

As it was very simple game we get almost the same results,  90 minutes to learn to the 20 reward.
DQN has more optimistic Q value estimations.

5 million frames two step noisy double dueling dqn:
Near 8 hours to learn.
